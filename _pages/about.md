The Alliance for Corporate Transparency brought together leading civil society organisations and experts to carry out the largest study on corporate sustainability reporting to date. The objective of the project is to provide evidence-based recommendations to improve and develop the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This initiative also serves as an open platform to discuss policy proposals on corporate transparency with civil society organisation companies, and investors.
