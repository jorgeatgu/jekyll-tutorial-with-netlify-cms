The Alliance was set up in 2018 by leading civil society organisations working in corporate sustainability and transparency. The project carried out an initial analysis of the reports of 105 companies from three sectors (ICT, Healthcare and Energy).

Please note that the methodology applied for the initial round has been updated in the second year of research. Level 1 has been merged inside each sustainability area. Similarly, consultations were held with partners and external stakeholders to ensure the research looked into the most crucial environmental, societal and anti-corruption risks and impacts.
