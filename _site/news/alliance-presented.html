      <h1>The Alliance for Corporate Transparency project presented at major events</h1>

      <p>On 18 October, the European Commission hosted an open stakeholder meeting on non-financial disclosures organised by DG FISMA (Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union), and Frank Bold’s Filip Gregor spoke at the event in order to present the Alliance for Corporate Transparency. The event was organised by the European Commission in order to gather feedback and advice from a wide variety of actors from both the corporate world and civil society and to allow key players such as regulators and members of civil society to share their views on the future of corporate reporting, gathering senior representatives from the financial sector, civil society, public administrations and universities. It provided the perfect opportunity to present the Alliance to a wide range of experts and legislators, as well as to gather feedback on the project itself. All the slides from Filip’s presentation at the meeting are available to view at the following link: http://bit.ly/2Pu65qW.</p>

<p>Following this, Filip Gregor attended the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights last November in order to present the project there. One session entitled “Elements of effective human rights due diligence regulation: lessons from legal developments”, took stock of the regulatory developments in corporate reporting which have prompted the creation of the Alliance for Corporate Transparency, with a focus on their outcomes, impacts on corporate accountability, and implementation by companies in order to draw lessons for further legislative developments. The measures considered or put into action around the world include, for example, the Brazilian “dirty list” of slave labor, EU Non-financial Reporting Directive, the French Duty of Vigilance law, the UK Modern Slavery Act, and the Responsible Business Conduct bill currently discussed in the Swiss Parliament.</p>

<p>Another session, entitled “Towards meaningful corporate human rights reporting?” saw Filip Gregor present his assessment of the non-financial reports of Nestlé and Rio Tinto to representatives of those companies, challenging them on their human rights records and offering advice for how these could be improved and better disclosed. This engagement with two large corporations proved beneficial for both sides, allowing the Alliance project to interact directly which the organisations it is assessing, while also helping the two companies to better understand how they can improve the quality of their reporting.</p>
