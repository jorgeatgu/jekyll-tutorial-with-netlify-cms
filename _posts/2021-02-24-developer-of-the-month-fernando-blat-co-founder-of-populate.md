### **Tell us what *Populate* is and how you ended up being its co-founder.**

*Populate* is a design and programming studio centered on creating products and projects around transparency, citizen participation and open data. It was set up by [Álvaro Ortiz](https://twitter.com/furilo) and myself because we wanted to create a company based on these very different areas, and we considered there were some interesting opportunities out there. 

At *Populate* we work for third parties, or we develop our own products such as *[Gobierto](https://gobierto.es/)*, an open source platform for open government that helps institutions comply with the Transparency Act and get closer to the citizens.

Another project we’ve created for another customer is *[España en Cifras](http://espanaencifras.elespanol.com/)* (Spain in figures), a snapshot of the municipalities in Spain based on the main socio-demographic and economic indicators such as unemployment, population, crime rates or active debt. The visualization of these data makes it easier to understand the reality of a municipality from an objective point of view.

The website and database of the Panama papers [Panama papers](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org%29/) has been another of our main jobs. The task here was to contribute to the graphic exploration of the people, intermediaries and all the other entities that appeared in the leaked material.
