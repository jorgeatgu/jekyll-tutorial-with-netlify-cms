<h1>Multi-stakeholder discussion</h1>

In 2020, Frank Bold initiated a process to build multi-stakeholder consensus on the legal framework for corporate sustainability reporting. 

After gathering input from the members of the Alliance for Corporate Transparency, Frank Bold drafted a “model law” that has been consulted and discussed with NGOs, trade unions as well as with 30 sustainability leaders from companies and investor firms. 

The purpose of the “model law” is to advance the debate on the reform of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the development of European reporting standards.

If you are interested to participate in the discussions, please get in touch with us via: <a href="mailto:joanne.houston@frankbold.org">joanne.houston@frankbold.org</a>.

<h3>Collaboration and partnerships</h3>

We join forces with other initiatives and institutions to organise events and roundtable discussions to address challenges in the reform and implementation of the legislation.

<h1>Context</h1>

Since 2018, large European companies and financial corporations are required to disclose information necessary to understand their societal and environmental risks and impacts. The EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, however, failed to specify which concrete information companies must disclose, severely undermining the legislation’s objective to increase the relevance, consistency and comparability of corporate sustainability data. 

To address this problem, in 2019, the European Commission initiated a legislative process to reform the Directive and develop European non-financial reporting standards. High quality sustainability reporting is critical for the EU sustainable finance strategy - an ambitious roadmap to mobilise private investment to enable the implementation of the actions set out in the European Green Deal, manage climate and environmental risks and to integrate sustainability into the financial system. Corporate reporting provides the information upon which all the other elements of this strategy depend.
