The Alliance for Corporate Transparency hosted a high-level event in Brussels on February 17 to present the conclusions of the largest research to date on corporate sustainability reporting. The project analysed the information disclosed by 1000 European companies on their environmental and societal risks and impacts, pursuant to the requirements introduced by the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive. 

The event gathered over 200 participants, including regulators, investor and company representatives, civil society organisations, think tanks and supervisory authorities. Speakers and participants discussed the necessary changes and reforms of the legal framework as the research was published at the same time as the EU Commission initiated the process to reform the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive. Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis also [announced](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/dombrovskis/announcements/speech-executive-vice-president-valdis-dombrovskis-ifrs-foundation-conference-financial-reporting_en) earlier that month plans to create EU standards for corporate sustainability reporting.

The Alliance for Corporate Transparency was set up with the objective of providing evidence and data to substantiate the debate on the standardisation of corporate sustainability reporting and the role of law. The results of the research are available in a public database (where it is possible to filter data and graphics by country or sector): [allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/database/](http://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/database/)

Speakers at the event included: 

- Members of the European Parliament Heidi Hautala, and Lara Wolters, Sebastien Godinot (WWF), Rosl Veltmeijer-Smits (Triodos), Lene Serpa (Maersk), Bastian Buck (GRI), Mirjam Wolfrum (CDP Europe), Eleni Choidas (ShareAction), Michael Zimonyi (CDSB). 
- Richard Howitt, expert on corporate sustainability and Phil Bloomer (Business and Human Rights Resource Center) moderated the debates. 
- Frank Bold’s Filip Gregor, alongside Carlos Cordero, Managing Partner at Sustentia, presented the key findings of the research. 
- The conference was closed by Alain Deckers, Head of Unit at DG FISMA (EU Commission) responsible for corporate reporting, audit and credit rating agencies. He welcomed the research and confirmed that the findings and conclusions of the project included in the [Research Report](http://bit.ly/2SQ70kv) are aligned with the EU Commission’s own assessment and that the NFR Directive is not currently meeting its objectives.
